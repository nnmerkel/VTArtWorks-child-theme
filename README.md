#VTArtWorks-child-theme
A backup of theme modifications for the VTArtWorks work sample

##Contents
* footer.php
* functions.php
* header.php
* styles.css

##A List of other changes and resources
* Download FontAwesome from http://fontawesome.io/ and place the files in a folder called "fontawesome" within the themes "wp-content" folder
* The custom footer code came from http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/dynamically-adding-four-footer-widget-areas--cms-22168. I shortened it to eliminate code and because I knew all four widget areas would always be populated.
